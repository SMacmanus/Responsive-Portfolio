                    title="Diggle running at sunset" />First, the most important thing you have to know about me is
                this: I have the very good fortune of being the owner of a grade-A, #1, top-notch pup, the world's very
                goodest good boy, DIGGLE THE WONDER DOG. I don't suppose anything else really matters after that. I'd
                stop right here for the sake of brevity, but will continue for the sake of my grade.<br>     
                I suppose I should also inform you that I had educational FOMO before that was even a thing. I
                participated in no fewer than 6 sports in high school (<i>it was a small school</i>). Meantime, I was
                also involved in about four academic UIL competitions, One Act Play, Technology Students Association,
                National Honor Society, and
                Student Council (<i>like, <b>really small</b> school</i>).<br>     
                In college I was first an international studies major with a concentration in Russian, before I switched
                to Theater Arts. After graduation I pursued a M.S. in Sport Physiology. Over the course of my time at
                Texas
                A&M I worked as a theater shop supervisor, and then as an undergraduate research assistant in the Bone
                Biology Lab (random side note: rat tibias are annoyingly tiny, and the safety measures in college labs
                regarding liquid nitrogen are alarmingly lax). For fun I joined the Rowing club for a semester,
                volunteer coached
                a local home school basketball team for 3 years, and was a member of the Aggie Angels - the men's
                basketball support club - for my final undergrad year.<br>     
                Long story short, I love learning. Like <i>really</i> love learning. And I'm so grateful for this
                bootcamp opportunity.</p>
